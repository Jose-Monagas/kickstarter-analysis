# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends and provide insights.

## Report of Kickstarter Campaigns
Based on the analysis performed to the Kickstarter data set, we can provide the following insights:

* The plays subcategory has the highest level rate of success among them. This is true for the US, GB, and all the other countries in the Data set.

* Louise should start her kickstarter between the months of May and June which is when the highest successful rate is observed. On the other hand, December doesn't seem like a great time to launch a campaign.

* Louise is asking for **more than twice** the average successful Kickstarter goal, so this isn't great news for her campaign in the USA.

*Based on these statistics, we can determine the following:
	•	The mean of each distribution is around the 3rd quartile, so the data follows similar distributions in each subset.
	•	The standard deviations are larger than the mean, which means everything below the mean is considered "close" to the center.
	•	Some large values are driving all of these distributions. The standard deviations are all roughly twice the IQR in each distribution, except in the failed Kickstarters, where the standard deviation is closer to three times the IQR. There must be some failed Kickstarters with really high goals!
* It is advised that Louise adjusts the goal under $4,000 for her next project in the UK, because it is above the 3rd quartile of the pledged kickstarters.
